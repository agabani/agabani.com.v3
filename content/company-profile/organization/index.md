# Organization

We operate via a highly efficient, robust structure that allows for a health and progressive growth in size, skill and quality.

It is the policy of AGABANI CONSULTANCY ltd. to assign to each of its projects a dedicated team. This team is composed of a group of skilled individuals assigned from various divisions on a full-time basis as required. Team members perform their respective duties in accordance with a set planned schedule and budget. Headed by a Project Manager responsible for directing all project activities, the Project Team is sustained during the project lifetime. All members of the Team, whilst responsible to the Project Manager for all matters related to the project, remain responsible to their Section and Department Heads for quality and conformity with design standards and practices adopted in AGABANI CONSULTANCY Ltd. Manuals.
